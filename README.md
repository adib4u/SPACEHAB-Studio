# 🌌 SpaceHab Studio

**Democratizing space design — from classrooms to NASA labs.**

---

## 🎮 What is SpaceHab Studio?

*SpaceHab Studio* is an **interactive simulation game** that transforms NASA’s complex **NHV (Net Habitable Volume) data** and habitat regulations into a hands-on, drag-and-drop design experience.

Players, students, and engineers can experiment with **crew layouts, essential habitat modules, and zoning rules** — while receiving **real-time validation** against NASA’s official Table 16 standards.

This isn’t just a game. It’s:

* 🚀 A **training tool** for engineers
* 🎓 An **educational platform** for students
* 🔬 A **research sandbox** for innovators

## 🎥 Key Features (Straight from the Demo)

* ✅ **Real-time NHV Tracking** – watch your hab volume balance update instantly
* 🏷 **NASA Compliance Validation** – green checks for correct builds, clear feedback for errors
* 🛠 **Drag-and-Drop Modules** – medical bays, exercise stations, sleeping quarters, labs & more
* 👩‍🚀 **Crew Configurations** – design for 4–6 astronauts with scalable layouts
* 🏗 **Multi-Deck Habitats** – stack modules into immersive 3-deck environments
* 📊 **Zoning Compliance Automation** – prevents critical placement mistakes (like treadmills next to bunks)

## 🌍 Why It Matters

Designing a habitat for Mars is **more than engineering** — it’s about ensuring human survival on a 7-month journey and beyond. NASA defines **18 essential habitat areas**, each with strict requirements. Misplacing even one system could mean **mission failure**.

*SpaceHab Studio* makes these challenges **accessible, visual, and fun**, empowering anyone to contribute ideas for humanity’s next leap.

## 📚 Who Is This For?

* **Students & Teachers** → Learn space architecture interactively
* **Engineers & Researchers** → Test concepts against validated NASA datasets
* **Gamers & Enthusiasts** → Experience the thrill of building humanity’s first Martian home

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

* 🌐 **Open Platform Expansion** – connect users worldwide to share designs
* 🧩 **API Integration** – plug NASA datasets into third-party tools and research apps
* 🏆 **Global Collaboration** – competitions, classrooms, and labs contributing habitat concepts
